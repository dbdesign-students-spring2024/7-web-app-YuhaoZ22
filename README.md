The home page of Coffee Design welcomes users with a vibrant header showcasing the brand's name. It provides a navigation bar with links to essential sections like Home, All Posts, and Design. A brief introduction highlights the website's mission to create the perfect cup of coffee tailored to users' preferences. Users are encouraged to explore the menu, read customer reviews, and start designing their own unique coffee experience. The footer includes a link to the source code on GitHub, fostering transparency and collaboration.

**Edit Page:**

The edit page of Coffee Design allows users to update their customized coffee design. It presents a form where users can modify their name, type of coffee beans, number of shots, and cup size. The form is pre-filled with the existing values of the design being edited. Users can select new options for coffee beans and cup size from dropdown menus. They can cancel the update and return to the read page by clicking the "Cancel" link or submit their changes by clicking the "Update" button.

**Create Page:**

The create page allows users to design their custom cup of coffee. It features input fields where users can enter their name, select the type of coffee beans (Arabica, Robusta, or Liberica) from a dropdown menu, specify the number of shots, and choose the cup size (Venti, Grande, or Tall) from another dropdown menu. Users can then submit their coffee order or cancel to return to the home page.

# Flask Run
I tried many time to flask run it by MongoDB Atlas, but I failed to navigate to each website pages.
